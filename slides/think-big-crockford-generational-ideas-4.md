    And the audience exploded in applause.

    While I understand the sentiment, I'm a little less pessimistic than Doug.
    I think what it really takes is understanding how to build real systems with our new way of thinking. Not Cat inherits from TerribleAnimal, but real, useful systems. Systems we make at work. Every day.

    So I want to provide a tour of some of the higher-level functional concepts I've come across in my journey. Application-level ideas, actionable ideas. I hope to give you the spark you need to realize you can do these things today. Right now. After lunch. When you get back to your desk.

    For those who've been either over- or under-whelmed FP as they've seen it.

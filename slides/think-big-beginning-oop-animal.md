note:
    Think back to the first time you learned OOP
    Put yourself there: what language? What was computer like?
    Think: what was the example? was it something like:
        * `Dog` inherits from `Animal`? Did you override the `speak` to say "woof" instead of whatever it is a `BaseAnimal` says?
        * Was it more like `Circle` inherits from Shape? And did you override `draw` so that it can differentiate itself from other shapes like `Square`, `Triangle`, etc.?

    Is this still what drives you today?

    We've exceled at it through determined practice,
    building large and complex systems
    We put in the work

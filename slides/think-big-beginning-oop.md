note:
    Think back to the first time you learned OOP
    Put yourself there: what language? What was computer like?
    Think: what was the example? was it something like:
        * `Dog` inherits from `Animal`? Did you override the `speak` to say "woof" instead of whatever it is a `BaseAnimal` says?
        * Was it more like `Circle` inherits from Shape? And did you override `draw` so that it can differentiate itself from other shapes like `Square`, `Triangle`, etc.?
    Does anyone have any other examples? Yell them out, don't open your eyes.
    What did it feel like... Did you fall in love with programming immediately?
    Did those examples get you fired up so much you decided to devote your career to this line of work?
    More importantly: is this still what drives you today?

    We have come to not only accept OOP, but to excel at it through determined practice, knowing we can build larger and sufficiently complex systems because we've seen it done. We put in the work. Imagine if we just stopped because we didn't see the point of `circle.draw()`?

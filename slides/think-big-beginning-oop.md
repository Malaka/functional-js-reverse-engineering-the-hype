# <em>Beginning OOP</em>
<br><br><br>

It reminds me of when I was first learning OOP. We created objects like Circle and Dog which inherits from Animal... But what good did that do us?

We have come to not only accept OOP, but to excel at it through determined practice, knowing we can build larger and sufficiently complex systems because we've seen it done. We put in the work. And so OOP is at our collective fingertips. Imagine if we just stopped because we didn't see the point of `circle.draw()`?

    You can see them pressing 's'.

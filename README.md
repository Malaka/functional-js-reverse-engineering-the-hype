## Functional JS: Reverse-engineering the Hype

_Begin with the End in Mind_. We'll use this age-old advice to examine the hype behind functional patterns in javascript. In place of mathematical proofs, we'll look at the results we can achieve with the tools available now, and dive into the functional ideas that drive them. The end goal is clear: to see if the hype is justified, we must look at how these patterns affect different parts of our front-end stack:

* Functional Rendering: fn(component, appState) == UI
* Data Management: Understandable data flow
* Performance: First simple, then FAST...

We can do all of this today with the tools and syntax we know and love, and there will be no shortage of recommendations on what to use and where to start.

Note: I am not affiliated in any way with the projects and libraries featured here, I just think they are the best options and want to give credit where credit is due.
